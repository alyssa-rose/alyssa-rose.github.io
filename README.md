### Personal Projects



### School Projects

[_A Predictive Classification Model of Cervical Cancer Diagnoses_](https://github.com/alyssa-rose/Cervical-Cancer-Analysis)
  - [The paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pVQnFLAQtbFUBalW_boQqgovmGz-N-N1/view?usp=sharing)
  
````
The project was concerned with using classification methods (Artificial Neural Networks and 
Support Vector Machines) and data compression methods (Singular Value Decomposition) to 
build a predictive classification model to predict the results of a cervical cancer 
diagnostic test.

[_Analysis of Global Food Shortages and Needs_](https://github.com/alyssa-rose/Final-Project-Backup)
````
The project aims to predict global food needs by region and food type for a given year using 
k-means clustering, interpolation and extrapolation. The data was taken from Kaggle and processed 
via MATLAB. The program includes a GUI to allow the user to choose the region, food type, and 
year range in order to determine the amount of food (in tons) needed to meet basic needs.
